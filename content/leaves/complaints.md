Alarmed by rising hostilities between colonial and Native peoples across the Delaware River in neighboring Pennsylvania, the Governor of the New Jersey Colony holds meetings in Crosswicks (approximately 18 miles south of Princeton) to hear grievances from Lunaapeew. As missionary John Brainerd (brother of David Brainerd) writes months later, "A bill is passed to remove the difficulties which had grown out of impositions upon the Indians when intoxicated, the destruction of deer by traps, and the occupation of lands by the whites which they had not sold." A number of Native land claims are settled, and the land is secured for the mission town of Brotherton. At Crosswicks, Native diplomats request a date for the conference that results in the 1758 Easton Treaty, amid the ongoing aggression in Eastern Pennsylvania and New York.
