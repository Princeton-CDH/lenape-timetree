title: 'Tlingit Art, Spirit, and Ancestry: Healing Histories of Dispossession Symposium'
---

In the late 19th century, Presbyterian missionaries brought hundreds of Tlingit belongings from southeastern Alaska to Princeton Theological Seminary. The art now resides in Princeton Universityâ€™s collections. In this symposium, Tlingit scholars and artists discuss: Where does Tlingit art belong at Princeton University, and how might knowledge be restored to those from whom the items were taken? The symposium marks the beginning of an ongoing partnership between Princeton University and the University of Alaska Southeast.
