Princetonâ€™s Indigenous Language Alliance aims to build a community for individuals at Princeton and beyond who are learning Indigenous languages, would like to learn Indigenous languages, or are interested in language revitalization more generally. The alliance includes graduate students, undergraduates, librarians, Princeton faculty and staff, scholars from the Institute of Advanced Studies, and language learners from other universities.
