Princetonâ€™s Indigenous Language Alliance is a community for individuals at Princeton and beyond who are learning or would like to learn Indigenous languages and who are interested in language revitalization. Its members hope to support language revitalization efforts among Native communities and increase access to language-learning opportunities for Native Princeton students. The alliance includes graduate students, undergraduates, librarians, Princeton faculty and staff, scholars from the Institute of Advanced Studies, and language learners from other universities.
