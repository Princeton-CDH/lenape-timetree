24 Native students matriculate at and eventually graduate from Princeton. Professor Alfonso Ortiz (Tewa) from Anthropology, and other colleagues work toward recruiting “real” Indians so they can benefit from a Princeton education. Soon after, Native students are awarded funding to support their travel home to participate in events that are key to their advancement into full adulthood.
