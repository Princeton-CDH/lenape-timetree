Munsee language teachers organize a Delaware (Lunaape) language camp with Princeton and IAS faculty. The gathering includes teachers from all of the Munsee-speaking nations, along with young adult community members who may become future teachers. The schedule includes traditional land-based learning, including time at the Seed Farm located in Princeton (which is a collaborative partnership with Ramapough Lunaape Nation members), as well as a half-day journey on the Millstone River, sharing Lunaape language, local history, and discussions of Indigenous sovereignty in todayâ€™s world.
