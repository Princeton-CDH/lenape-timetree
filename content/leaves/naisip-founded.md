The Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative at Princeton is awarded a [Humanities Council grant](https://effroncenter.princeton.edu/news/2020/sarah-rivett-naisip-receive-humanities-council-exploratory-grant) to Professor Sarah Rivett in 2020 to assemble an interdisciplinary working group of faculty, a number of student groups, and Library and Museum staff whose interests focus on Indigenous peoples. Launched in 2021, [NAISIP](https://indigenous.princeton.edu) increases awareness of the cultural traditions and experiences of Indigenous peoples globally, as well as over the course of the Universityâ€™s history.
