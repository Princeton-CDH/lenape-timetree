Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative is awarded a Humanities Council  grant to Professor Sarah Rivett in 2020 to assemble an interdisciplinary working group of faculty, a number of student groups, and Library and Museum staff whose interests focus on Indigenous peoples. Launched in 2021, NAISIP increases awareness of the cultural traditions and experiences of Indigenous peoples globally, as well as over the course of the Universityâ€™s history.
