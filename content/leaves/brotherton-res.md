Under the terms of the 1758 Treaty of Easton , the first Native reservation in the colonies – Brotherton Reservation – is established near Medford Lakes, now known as Indian Mills, NJ. Brotherton is intended to “accommodate” (or concentrate) Lunaapeew who refuse to leave their land. David Brainerd is appointed guardian of Lunaapeew now called Brotherton Indians.
