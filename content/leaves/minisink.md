The Munsee Lenape live along the Upper Delaware, in a region called Minisink, and along Muhheakantuck, or the “Hudson.” The land that became “Princeton” is likely home to both Munsee and Unami Lenape. “Unami” is how the Munsee refer to their relatives in the south, and “Munsee” is how the Unami refer to their relatives in the north.
