In 1756, the construction of Nassau Hall is completed on FitzRandolph’s 4.5 acre donation, and the College of New Jersey moves from Newark to Princeton. FitzRandolph proudly records this moment in his journal on November 13th 1756: “Aaron Burr, President, preached the first sermon and began the school in Princeton College.”
