In 1756, the construction of Nassau Hall is completed on FitzRandolph’s 4.5 acre donation and the College of New Jersey moves from Newark to Princeton. FitzRandolph proudly records this moment in his journal on November 13 1756: “Aaron Burr, President, preached the first sermon and began the school in Princeton College.” When built, the Nassau was the largest stone buildings in the Colonies and it is most likely where the University's earliest Native students such as Jacob Wooley boarded (in 1759).
