During the French-Indian War (1754 to 1763), the Lenape who have been forced into the Susquehanna and Ohio River Valleys (after the Walking Purchase) ally with the French. British colonial governors introduce the 1758 Treaty of Easton to the Lenape and other Native nations. The last of Lenape land in “New Jersey” is “ceded” for $1,000 Spanish dollars.
