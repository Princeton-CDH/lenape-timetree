The inaugural Munsee Language & History Symposium at Princeton in 2021 is the first event to bring “Princeton faculty and students in direct dialogue with members of the Munsee-Delaware Nation." Language keepers Karen Mosko and Ian McCallum, historian Mark Peters, and a number of Native activists and artists lead discussions of Munsee language, history, and culture. The second symposium in October 2022 commemorates Mosko and Peters who passed away just months earlier. The [Munsee Language & History Symposium](https://effroncenter.princeton.edu/events/2021/munsee-language-symposium) continues as an annual gathering in support of Lunaape language revitalization efforts.
