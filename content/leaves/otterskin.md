title: Brainerd's Otterskin Book
---

University President Jonathan Edward's bound otterskin book is presented to the University Library by Mrs. William Edwards. The Hebrew Lexicon (ca. 1645) with its otterskin binding is likely the work of Lunaapeew for missionary David Brainerd. David Brainerd was a pioneer missionary among Native peoples after been expelled from Yale for his New Light Presbyterian beliefs and comments about an impious faculty member. He founded Bethel Indian Town (ten miles from Princeton). The book was bestowed to his friend University President Edwards when Brainerd died in 1747.
