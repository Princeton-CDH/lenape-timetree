Around 1858, Presbyterian Reverend Dr. Sheldon Jackson graduates from the Princeton Theological Seminary  (founded in 1812 by the College of NJ and the Presbyterian Church). For the next 15 years, he works as a missionary for the Oklahoma Choctaw and then the American West. In 1877, he begins mission work in Alaska (purchased by the U.S. from Russia in 1867) and Siberia creating schools and collecting cultural objects to ensure Indigenous cultural survival. In 1879, he establishes the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, an Indian boarding school in Pennsylvania, 160 miles from Princeton.
