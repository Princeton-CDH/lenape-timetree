In the 1794 Jay Treaty between Britain and the United States, Britain withdraws their association with Native Americans south of Canada, weakening the position of pro-British Native Americans in the United States. Months later, the Delaware and several nations sign the Treaty of Greenville with the colonial Americans. For an annuity of approximately $9,500 they “cede” all but a patch of Ohio land, which the United States retains the right to purchase. Ohio Delaware migrate to join the White River Delaware at the invitation of the Miami. Their settlement along the west fork of the White River, Indiana provides a buffer against white settlers moving into southern areas of Indiana.
