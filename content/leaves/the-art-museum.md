Sheldon Jackson begins to donate Native American belongings mainly from Alaska, Pacific Northwest Coast and Southwest to Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1882, the collection is transferred to the College of NJ, where the Art Museum carries Indigenous Stories. The collection is supplemented by additional Jackson donations in 1883 and 1885.
