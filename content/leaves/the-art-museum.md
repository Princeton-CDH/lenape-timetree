Sheldon Jackson begins to donate Native American belongings mainly from Alaska, Pacific Northwest Coast and the Southwest to Princeton Theological Seminary. The collection is supplemented by additional Jackson donations in 1883 and 1885. In 1886, William Libby 1877 returns from an expedition in Alaska with Takutat Tlingit material, including materials from ashamanâ€™s grave. In 1882, the collection is transferred to the College of NJ, and the Museum of Geology and Archaeology, in the faculty room in Nassau Hall, and subsequently to Guyot Hall. The collection is now on loan to the Art Museum.
