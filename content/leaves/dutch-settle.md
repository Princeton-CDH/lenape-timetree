Dutch explorers establish trade with Lunaapeew in the early 1610s and then build settlements on both sides of Lenapewihittuck (the Delaware) in the 1620s. Lunaape homelands are increasingly populated with Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English settlers. They use Lunaape trails to explore the land and transport resources. They also introduce diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza that would devastate many Indigenous nations.
