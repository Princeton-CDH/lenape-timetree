The University Library deepens its commitment to indigenous studies with the newly organized Indigenous Studies Libguide, the Indigenous Cultures online collection, and a  digitized collection of Lunappee/Delaware language items. A print collection opens on the first floor of Firestone Library focused on Indigenous Studies. The first shelf is a “living land acknowledgement” featuring books related to the Munsee community and relevant campus history. The other shelves feature voices of Indigenous authors. Visitors are encouraged to browse and borrow the books and to suggest additions to the collection, which includes materials from across the world. Natalie Diaz, Pulitzer-prize winning author, meets with Native graduate students in the space which is suitable for small conversational events.
