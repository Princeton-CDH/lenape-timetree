The Seed Farm is an interdisciplinary research project that grows rare and culturally-meaningful seeds on a 3.5 acre farm near the campus. The project works with community partners such as the Experimental Farm Network, Munsee Three Sisters Medicinal Farm, and the Ujamaa Cooperative Farming Alliance to ask broad research questions related to ecological and social repair and mutualisms. The farm hosts regular Saturday workdays and other events. The farm plot is nestled amidst the 99-acre Stony Ford property, which is managed and supported by the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. [See https://seedfarm.princeton.edu]
