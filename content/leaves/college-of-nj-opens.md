In April 1747, the College of New Jersey holds its first classes in the parsonage of first president Jonathan Dickinson in Elizabethtown. Later that year, the College moves to Newark â€“ home of second president, Aaron Burr. Meanwhile, Burr and the trustees seek out a permanent land base for the College.
