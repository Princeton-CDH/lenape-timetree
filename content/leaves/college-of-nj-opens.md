In April 1747, the College of New Jersey holds its first classes in the parsonage of first president Jonathan Dickinson in Elizabethtown, New Jersey. Later that year, the College moves to Newark, home of second president, Aaron Burr. Meanwhile, Burr and the trustees seek out a permanent land base for the College.
