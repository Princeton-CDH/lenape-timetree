title: Sand Hill Indians of Monmouth County

The history of the Sand Hill Indians who live on the northern shores of Monmouth County, New Jersey, can be traced back to the eighteenth century. Lunaape communities had lived in the area for centuries, when a Cherokee family named the Richardsons left their Georgia homelands in the late eighteenth century for New York and New Jersey to live alongside their Lunaape cousins, the Reveys. After living in Eatontown, New Jersey, for over thirty years, Isaac and Elizabeth Richardson move their family to Asbury Park in 1877. The family becomes known as the “Sand Hill Indians” after the hill on their 20-acre property. Sand Hill families grow in number with each generation, and many continue to live in the area today.
