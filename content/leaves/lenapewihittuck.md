By the early 1600s, Lunaapeew have lived along Lenapewihittuck and its tributaries for millennia. Lenapewihittuck is Lunaape for “rapid stream of the Lunaape.” English settlers name it the “Delaware” after Lord de la Warr III, governor of the Virginia colony. Later, settlers refer to both the Munsee and the Unami Lenape as the “Delaware" – people of Lenapewihittuck.
