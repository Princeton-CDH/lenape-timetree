William Potter Ross graduates from College of NJ first in his class around 1842, after being sent to Princeton by his uncle and prominent Cherokee statesman Chief John Ross. William is a slave-holder who defends the generous treatment of slaves, and serves as a Confederate officer and diplomat during the Civil War. He is elected to succeed his uncle as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation in 1866, after the Civil War.
