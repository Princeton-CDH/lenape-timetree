William Potter Ross graduates from the College of New Jersey first in his class around 1842. His uncle and prominent Cherokee statesman Chief John Ross funded William's education. William is a slave-holder who defends the generous treatment of slaves, and serves as a Confederate officer and diplomat during the Civil War. He is elected to succeed his uncle as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation in 1866, after the Civil War.
