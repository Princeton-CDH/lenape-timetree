According to legend, William Penn enters into a treaty with the Lenape in 1682. The Treaty of Shackamaxon is signed under an elm tree in a Lenape village north of Philadelphia. Penn signs agreements with the Lenape that bring lands deeded to him under his absolute title, while still recognizing and reserving certain lands for the Lenape where their villages are located.
