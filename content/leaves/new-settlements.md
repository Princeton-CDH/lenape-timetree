Dutch explorers build settlements on both sides of Lenapewihittuck (the Delaware) and Lenape homelands are increasingly populated with Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English settlers. They use Lenape trails to explore the land and transport resources. They also transport diseases – like smallpox, measles, and influenza – which devastate many indigenous nations.
