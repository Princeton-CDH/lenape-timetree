Dutch explorers establish trade with Lenape peoples in the early 1610s and then build settlements on both sides of Lenapewihittuck (the Delaware) in the 1620s. Lenape homelands are increasingly populated with Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English settlers. They use Lenape trails to explore the land and transport resources. They also transport diseases – like smallpox, measles, and influenza – which would devastate many indigenous nations.
