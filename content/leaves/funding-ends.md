George Morgan White Eyes learns the truth about his fatherâ€™s murder by a white man; Col. Morgan leaves for Missouri and recommends to Congress that George Morgan White Eyes continue education elsewhere; George writes series of petitions to George Washington to have his education funded, but these are ignored and he eventually gives up and asks for permission to return to Ohio.
