The Lenape encounter Europeans around 1524, when Giovanni de Verrazano, an Italian, explores Lenapehoking. In 1609, the Lenape encounter Henry Hudson in the Dutch ship the Half Moon. Financed by the Dutch East India Company, Hudson claims lands along Muhheakantuck River (later named the Hudson). He reports meeting the Lenape along the west shore.
