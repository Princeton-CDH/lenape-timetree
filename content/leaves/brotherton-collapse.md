Brotherton Indians release statement of refusal to leave New Jersey after Oneidas in Stockbridge, New York and invite Brothertonâ€™s members to join them. By 1802, however, the 80 remaining residents successfully petition the state legislature for permission to sell their land and use the funds to move to Oneida Lake in New York.
