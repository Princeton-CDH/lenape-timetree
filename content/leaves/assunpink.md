Route 27, Nassau Street in Princeton, is a Lunaape trail called the Assunpink, meaning “rocky, watery place.” European settlers find the trail useful since it connects two rivers – the Raritan and Lenapewihittuck, which Europeans name the Delaware. Over the centuries, the Assunpink Trail is New Jersey’s main North-South road.
