Not only is Thomas and John Penns' deed underlying the "Walking Purchase" itself highly suspect, but they recruit runners, not walkers, for the job of marking the extent of the purchase. Further, colonial agents clear a path for the runners in a reconnaissance of the territory beforehand. As a result, the Penn brothers seize 750,000 acres of Lunaape land.
