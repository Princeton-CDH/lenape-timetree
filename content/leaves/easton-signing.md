At the Easton signing, the Lenape representative Teedyuscung makes it clear that the deceit of the Walking Purchase had led the Lenape to fight against the British. Native chiefs exact a promise from the British to recognize Indigenous fishing and hunting rights, and, in exchange, Native nations vouch not to ally with the French. The British do not keep their promise to protect usufructuary rights.
