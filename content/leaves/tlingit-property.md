The Tlingit Art, Spirit, and Ancestry: Healing Histories of Dispossession Symposium reunites Tlingit scholars and artists with Tlingit belongings held at the Princeton University Art Museum. In the late nineteenth century, Presbyterian missionary Reverend Dr. Sheldon Jackson, Professor William Libbey (class of 1877), and Lieutenant George T. Emmons brought hundreds of Tlingit belongings from southeastern Alaska to the Princeton Theological Seminary. Moving from the Department of Geosciences to the Art of the Ancient Americas, the institutional drift of these Tlingit belongings reflects an ongoing condition of broken knowledge. The aim of the symposium is to confront histories of dispossession and ask how we can restore ancestral connections. This symposium marks the beginning of an ongoing partnership between Princeton University and the University of Alaska Southeast.
