---

Thanks largely to the donation and fund-raising work of Nathaniel FitzRandolph – son of an “original Quaker settler” – Princeton outbids New Brunswick for the honor, providing 1,700 New Jersey pounds in funding, 10 acres of “cleared” land for the campus, and 200 acres of woodland for fuel. FitzRandolph alone donates 4.5 acres. There is no recorded consultation between Nathaniel FitzRandolph’s ancestors and the Lenape people. Likewise, there is no mention of the Lenape people in the documents detailing the enormous “land donation” from the people of Princeton to the College of New Jersey in the mid-1700s.
