Route 27, or Princeton’s Nassau Street, is a Lenape trail called the Assunpink, meaning “rocky, watery place.” European settlers find the trail useful, since it connects two rivers – the Raritan and Lenapewihittuck, which they name the Delaware. Over the centuries, the Assunpink Trail is New Jersey’s main road.
