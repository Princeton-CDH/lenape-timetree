Mark Peters, Munsee–Delaware Nation member who served his people in many different roles, was a dedicated historian who shared his knowledge within the community and far beyond, both through his travels and through online video lectures. Those at Princeton will long remember his time on Lunaapahkiing, along with his daughter Katelyn, for the inaugural Munsee Language and History Symposium in November 2021. Together with Ian McCallum, he spent time with Lunaape language items and Munsee land documents at Firestone Library's Special Collections. He is greatly missed by all those who knew him. To learn more about Munsee history from Mark Peters, you can watch his lectures posted by the Public History Project at Rutgers-Newark, or his [YouTube channel, "Manhattan to Muncey."](https://www.youtube.com/@manhattantomuncey8836)
