title: Munsee in Wisconsin
---

Small groups of Christian Munsee and Unami converts remaining along the Hudson and Delaware River valleys relocate with Munsee and Mahicans living in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, to a reservation in Wisconsin. They are recognized today as Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians. Among those who moved to Wisconsin was Bartholemew Calvin who matriculated at the College of New Jersey in 1774.
