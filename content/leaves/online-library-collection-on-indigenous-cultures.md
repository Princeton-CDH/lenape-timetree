title: Online Library Collection on Indigenous Cultures
---

The Princeton University Library publishes the online collection of the American Indian Affair records which includes over 240 digitized books and manuscripts, some selected by librarians and others requested by Indigenous researchers. Records include land deeds, missionary-created language dictionaries and translations of religious documents. Graduate students work with librarians to create searchable Munsee dictionaries from the newly-digitized books. [See https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures]
