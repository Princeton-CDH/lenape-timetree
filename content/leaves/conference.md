[“Indigenous/Settler”](https://indigenoussettler.princeton.edu) conference examines methods for thinking across geographies, building alliances, and fighting settler colonialism at large without abandoning attention to specific histories and struggles. Located on the site of Lunaapahkiing—and from the ground of Princeton’s colonial establishment—the conference explores and historicizes what has been called “trans” or “pan” or “global” Indigenous studies."
