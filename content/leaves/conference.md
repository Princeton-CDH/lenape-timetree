“Indigenous/Settler” conference examines methods for thinking across geographies, building alliances, and fighting settler colonialism at large without abandoning attention to specific histories and struggles. Located on the site of Lunaapahkiing — and from the ground of Princeton’s colonial establishment — the conference explores and historicizes what has been called “trans” or “pan” or “global” Indigenous studies" [see https://indigenoussettler.princeton.edu]
