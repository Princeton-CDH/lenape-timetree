As the sixth president of the College of NJ, John Witherspoon reflects on “experiment” of educating Native Americans: “On the whole it does not appear, that either by our people going among them, or by their being brought among us, that it is possible to give them a relish of civilized life. There have been some of them educated at this college, as well as in New England; but seldom if never did they ever prove good or useful.” Although Witherspoon held slaves, he supported their Christian instruction and education and he tutored two free African men.
