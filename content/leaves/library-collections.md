The Association on American Indian Affairs donates its records to the Princeton University Library. (They are later made available online in 2023). The collection includes organizational files, books, audiovisual material, language dictionaries, and translations of religious documents from 1851-2016 (mostly 1922-1995) [See https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures]
