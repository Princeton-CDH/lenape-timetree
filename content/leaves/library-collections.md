---

The Association on American Indian Affairs donates its records to the Princeton University Library. (They are later made [available online in 2023](https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures)). The collection includes organizational files, books, audiovisual material, language dictionaries, and translations of religious documents from 1851-2016 (mostly 1922-1995).
