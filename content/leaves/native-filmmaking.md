Hopi student Victor Masayesva, Jr. writes senior thesis on “Hopi Oral Tradition” but is resistant to writing in languages other than Hopi. He returns to his community after graduate school (University of Arizona), where he begins to create an award-winning  body of work of oral histories, photography and documentary films. Using these expressive forms, he develops a form of poetic image-making based in the Native American philosophies and practices and made in the contexts where they originate. Some of these works confront the Hollywood imagination of Native Americans as well as the conditions in which they are employed as movie extras (e.g. Imagining Indians). (See Weatherford 1995)
