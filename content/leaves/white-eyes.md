Chief White Eyes (named Koquethagechton) is a principal chief among the Lunaapeew, and a key figure in maintaining tribal neutrality and protecting native land during the American Revolutionary War. Chief White Eyes is one of the signatories on the 1778 Treaty of Fort Pitt and marries Rachael Doddridge, an assimilated English young woman captured in a Lunaape raid at age 5. He works closely and strikes up a friendship with Colonel George Morgan at Fort Pitt.
