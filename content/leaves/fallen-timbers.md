Battle of Fallen Timbers (in present-day northwestern Ohio): Americans defeat intertribal confederacy of Delaware, Shawnee, and a number of other Indigenous forces. The Delaware in this instance are the Delaware who had remained in Ohio during the American Revolution and who become the Delaware Tribe of Indians. The battle leads to the Greenville Treaty the following year, in which most of Ohio Country would be ceded to the colonial Americans.
