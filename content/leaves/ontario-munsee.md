Following the American Revolution in the late 1700s, some pro-British Munsee groups living in the Ohio Country during the American Revolution migrate toward the Thames River in Ontario. They had been known previously as Munsee of the Thames, and now the Munsee-Delaware Nation, and Moravian of the Thames are now known as the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown.
