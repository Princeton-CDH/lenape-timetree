In 1832, Lunaapeew in Wisconsin successfully petition the State of New Jersey for compensation based on claims to lost fishing and hunting rights promised by the 1758 Treaty of Easton. Bartholomew Calvin, who had moved to Wisconsin in 1823, serves as attorney for Lunaapeew and at age 76 appears before the New Jersey state legislature.
