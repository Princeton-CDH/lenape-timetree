Penn hopes to make a profit from purchasing and selling lands and by collecting taxes. Yet his Quaker values oblige him to treat the Lenape equally. He demands of his fellow Quakers that “no man shall … in word or deed, affront or wrong any Indian.” Penn’s reputation as a benevolent settler lives on.
