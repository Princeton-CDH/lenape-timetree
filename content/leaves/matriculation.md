George Morgan White Eyes matriculates at College of NJ in 1785. Tuition is paid by  Continental Congress resulting in first “US” aid to education designated for three Lunaape students (though the Lunaapeew later learn that they are expected to repay the expense with a grant of Delaware land); this is allegedly a result of Col. Morgan’s lobbying following the murder of his friend Chief White Eyes.
