George Morgan White Eyes matriculates at the College of New Jersey in 1785. Tuition is paid by the Continental Congress resulting in the first instance of “U.S. aid" to education which is designated for three Lunaape students, George Morgan White Eyes and the Killbuck Brothers. This aid is said to be a result of Colonel Morgan’s lobbying following the murder of his friend Chief White Eyes. The Lunaapeew later learn that they are expected to repay the expense with a grant of their land.
