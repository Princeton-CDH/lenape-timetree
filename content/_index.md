*Relations, Removals, Resurgence*

Explore the timetree by selecting leaves and tags to illuminate relations of deception, dispossession, as well as affinity and alliance. Some leaves highlight Native Americans who have belonged to the University community since it took root in Princeton, while others feature current projects that uphold the *Lunaapeew* as caretakers of their languages, lands, and cultural futures.
