This project is based on  work by Jiyoun Roh ’24 in a term paper for “Indigenous Literatures” (ENG 229) taught by Professor Sarah Rivett. In her paper, Roh used “the form of a tree as a representation of time” to show Princeton’s indigenous history without following a strict chronological sequence and in “direct contrast to the linear structure of the university timeline” as it is displayed online as the [official history of Princeton University](http://princeton.edu/meet-princeton/history). Roh’s concept was so compelling that there was interest from multiple groups to develop it into a public visualization. In summer 2021, Rivett gathered a group of scholars in indigenous history, web developers, with advisors from the VizE Lab (J. Himpele, Anthropology) and the Center for Digital Humanities (N. Ermolaev). After an initial 9-month period of experiments with visualization software and historical research, the project was completed in a year-long creative and technical collaboration between Anthropology’s VizE Lab and the Center for Digital Humanities, which supported the project with a Research Partnership grant.
 
This project is a component of the [Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative at Princeton](http://indigenous.princeton.edu/). It arises from an ongoing collaboration with Lunaapeew communities, in particular the Munsee-Delaware in Ontario, and we seek to continue these collaborations by using the site as a virtual meeting ground. The project site is designed to continue integrating Indigenous knowledges and histories.
