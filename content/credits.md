A research partnership collaboration between The VizE Lab, Department of Anthropology, and the Center for Digital Humanities.

The timetree was conceived by Jiyoun Roh ’24 in a term paper for “Indigenous Literatures” (ENG 229) taught by Professor Sarah Rivett. In her paper, Roh proposed a nonlinear tree image of Princeton’s native history that would subvert the linear view of time that organizes the history of Princeton University on its website. In summer 2021, Rivett launched the project with a group of scholars in indigenous history, web developers, as well as coordinators from the VizE Lab (J. Himpele, Anthropology) and the Center for Digital Humanities (N. Ermolaev). After an initial 9-month period of experiments with visualization software and historical research, the project was completed in a year-long creative and technical collaboration between Anthropology’s VizE Lab and the Center for Digital Humanities, which supported the project with a Research Partnership grant.
 
This project is an active component of the Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative at Princeton. It arises from an ongoing collaboration with Lunaapeew communities, in particular the Munsee-Delaware in Ontario, and we seek to continue these collaborations by using the site as a virtual meeting ground. The project site is designed to continue integrating Indigenous knowledges and histories.
