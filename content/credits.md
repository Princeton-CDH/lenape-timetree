## Project History and Future

This project is based on  work by Jiyoun Roh ’24 in a term paper for “Indigenous Literatures” (ENG 229) taught by Professor Sarah Rivett. In her paper, Roh used “the form of a tree as a representation of time” to show Princeton’s Indigenous history without following a strict chronological sequence and in “direct contrast to the linear structure of the university timeline” as it is displayed online as the [official history of Princeton University.](http://princeton.edu/meet-princeton/history) Roh’s concept was so compelling that there was interest from multiple groups to develop it into a public visualization. In summer 2021, Rivett gathered a group of scholars in Indigenous history, web developers, with advisors from the VizE Lab (J. Himpele, Anthropology) and the Center for Digital Humanities (N. Ermolaev) for an initial nine-month period of experiments with visualization software, historical research by Isabel Lockhart \*22, and illustrations by Lola Constantino ‘23. In ‘22-’23, project development entered a new phase with a year-long creative collaboration between Jeffrey Himpele and the Center for Digital Humanities, which supported the project with a Research Partnership grant.

This project is in community with the [Native American and Indigenous Studies Initiative at Princeton](http://indigenous.princeton.edu/). It involves ongoing collaboration with Lunaape communities, in particular the Munsee-Delaware Nation in Ontario, as well as language keepers from several other communities. We seek to continue these collaborations by using the site as a virtual meeting ground. The project has also benefited from the feedback of participants at the Munsee Language and History Symposia in 2021-2023. The site is intended to continue integrating Indigenous knowledges and histories.
